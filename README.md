## Usage

Install comportex.
Install comportexviz.

"lein cljsbuild once"
(or "lein cljsbuild auto")

"lein gorilla"

Open the worksheet. Use URL "/worksheet.html?filename=worksheet.clj"

Start evaluating rows.

Evaluating "model" will fail on the first try. It will work on the second.

Past that, I'm not sure yet :)
